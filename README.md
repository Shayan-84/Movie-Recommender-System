# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to suggest relevant movies to users based on similarity patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset
- Movie rating dataset
- Includes user ratings and movie metadata
- Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed before analysis

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Similarity-based recommendation
- Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

## Project Structure
- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling
- data/ : Dataset files
- assets/ : Visualizations and figures (if applicable)

## Results
- The system generates personalized movie recommendations
- Similarity metrics are used to identify related movies

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries
3. Open the notebook and run the cells step by step

## Project Status
Completed – open for improvements and experimentation
